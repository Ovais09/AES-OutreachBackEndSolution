# How to run the JavaScript file

In order to run the JavaScript file, Node.js must be installed on the user's PC (Node.js link: https://nodejs.org/en/) <br>

Then using the NPM package manager, the axios library must be downloaded in the same folder as the JavaScript file. This can be done by: <br>
```
npm install axios
```

<br>

Finally, the user must enter in the command: <brt>
```
node index.js
```
  
to run the JavaScript file.
